Adapted from https://javascript30.com - Sorting band names without articles

Changes:
* moved CSS + JS to external files
* [HTML] changed favicon
* [JS] â€¦ a lot.
  I tried to complete the challenge before watching the rest of the video (as
  suggested) and I fear that I may have massively overcomplicated the matter.
* [CSS] added a basic reset
* [CSS] removed unused rule
* [CSS] changed marker color
* [CSS] increased font size
-->
<!--
New elements:
New attributes:
New JS:
* JSDoc - I missed having type-based completions in VScode from TypeScript
* Creating a DOM element - not really new, I just forgot how to and had to
  double-check on W3Schools
* Learned about the ability to pass a function to the Array.sort() method
